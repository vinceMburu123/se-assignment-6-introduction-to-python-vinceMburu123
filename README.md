# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.
   Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. Key features that make Python popular include:

Readability: Python's syntax is clear and concise, making it easy to learn and read.
Versatility: Python can be used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.
Extensive Libraries: Python has a vast standard library and numerous third-party packages available through the Python Package Index (PyPI).
Community Support: Python has a large and active community, providing a wealth of resources and support.
Portability: Python code can run on various platforms without modification.

Web Development: Using frameworks like Django and Flask.
Data Science and Machine Learning: Using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
Automation and Scripting: Automating repetitive tasks and scripting complex operations.
Scientific Computing: Using libraries like SciPy and SymPy.
2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
   Download Python from the official website.
Run the installer and ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked.
Verify the installation:
sh
Copy code
python --version
Set up a virtual environment:
sh
Copy code
python -m venv myenv
Activate the environment:
sh
Copy code
myenv\Scripts\activate

macOS:
Install Homebrew if not already installed:
sh
Copy code
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
Install Python:
sh
Copy code
brew install python
Verify the installation:
sh
Copy code
python3 --version
Set up a virtual environment:
sh
Copy code
python3 -m venv myenv


3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

   print("Hello, World!")
print: A built-in function in Python used to output text to the console.
"Hello, World!": A string literal enclosed in double quotes

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

int: Integer, e.g., 42
float: Floating-point number, e.g., 3.14
str: String, e.g., "Hello"
bool: Boolean, e.g., True or False
list: Ordered, mutable collection, e.g., [1, 2, 3]
tuple: Ordered, immutable collection, e.g., (1, 2, 3)
dict: Key-value pairs, e.g., {"key": "value"}
set: Unordered collection of unique elements, e.g., {1, 2, 3}
Example Script:

python
Copy code
# Variables of different data types
integer_var = 42
float_var = 3.14
string_var = "Hello, Python"
boolean_var = True
list_var = [1, 2, 3]
tuple_var = (4, 5, 6)
dict_var = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
set_var = {7, 8, 9}

# Printing variables
print(integer_var)
print(float_var)
print(string_var)
print(boolean_var)
print(list_var)
print(tuple_var)
print(dict_var)
print(set_var)

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")
Loops: Used to repeat a block of code multiple times.
Example:

python
Copy code
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)


6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.


Functions: Reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code, making it more modular and readable.

Example Function:

python
Copy code
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Calling the function
result = add_numbers(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

   ists: Ordered collections of elements that can be accessed by their index.
Dictionaries: Unordered collections of key-value pairs.

Example Script:

python
Copy code
# List of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[2])  # Accessing the third element

# Dictionary with key-value pairs
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
print(person["name"])  # Accessing value by key

# Adding elements
numbers.append(6)
person["email"] = "alice@example.com"

print(numbers)
print(person)

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

Exception Handling: A mechanism to handle runtime errors, allowing the program to continue running.

Example:

python
Copy code
try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    # Handling the exception
    print("Error:", e)
finally:
    # Code that will run no matter what
    print("Execution finished")

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

   Modules: Single files of Python code that can be imported.
Packages: Collections of modules.

Example:

python
Copy code
import math

# Using functions from the math module
print(math.sqrt(16))
print(math.pi)

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

# Writing to a file
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, file!")

# Reading from a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)


# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
